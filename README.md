# About the mini-project:
This project was created as part of the application process for a Computer Vision role. The program consumes two image 
files from `images/` and attempts to find the rotation of the object between the two images in degrees.

**There is a Jupyter Notebook in this repository** which highlights all the inference and experimentation done while
creating this program. It's messy but conveys my thought process, and various attempts I made. It may not run in the
currently organized repository.

Thanks, Puru, for this challenge!

## How to run the program:
1) Use `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages to run the program.
2) In `main.py`, change the constants under "FOR USER TO MODIFY" according to the instructions provided.
3) Run the program either using `python3 main.py` or using the Run configuration in your editor.
*Note: I would recommend running using the Command Prompt.*

This program was tested using **Python 3.9** on Linux. Minimal testing was conducted, so run the program at your own 
discretion.
